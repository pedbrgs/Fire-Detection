## About

<p align="justify"> This repository contains the models and source codes of some fire detection systems implemented during my master's degree, as well as some baseline models for comparison purposes. The proposed models are convolutional neural networks for fire detection (classification and location) and the baseline models are convolutional neural networks for fire classification. </p>
